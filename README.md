I study high latitude oceanography, with a focus on transport of heat across basins and scales. 

Currently, I'm working to understand (sub)mesoscale processes that transport of heat across the East Antarctic continental slope and shelf, where quantifying advection of heat is crucial for estimating mass loss from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.  

Previously, I studied heat transport processes in the subpolar North Atlantic and onto Greenland's continental shelf. In the open ocean, I focussed on variabiltiy in eddy transport of heat from the Irminger Current into the Irminger Sea which drives restratification of the water column following wintertime deep convection. looking at interannual variability in wintertime convection and subsequent restratification. At the continental margins, I studied the role of bathymetric troughs in driving cross-shelf exchange of water masses and providing an environment for enhanced mixing. 

My work is motivated by a need to understand the role of high latitude oceans in the global climate system and how these regions will respond to our changing climate.
