Monica Nelson, Physical Oceanography PhD student, Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

I study gyre processes in the subpolar North Atlantic. I'm currently focussing on heat exchange, looking at interannual variability in wintertime convection and subsequent restratification.
In future work I'm hoping to look at how the physical varibility in the region affects variability in gas exchange between surface and deep waters.
My work is motivated by understanding how this region will respond to climate and how changes in this region will affect climate.
